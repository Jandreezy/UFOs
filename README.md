# UFOs Sightings

## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

## Summary
The filtering on the page needs work. For example, typing in El Cajon does not pull the data for "el cajon." There was a space added in "el cajon " so searching for El Cajon won't pull the data. The data is also limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source. In addition to fixing the case-sensitive nature of the search, I feel that there are additional functionalities that can be added. Things like being able to pull live data and adding drop down menus for the filters would make searching for data easier as well as having the most up to date information.
